# local-highlight.nvim

Using regexes and extmarks to highlight uses of word under the cursor.
Keeps updates local to currently visible lines, thus enabling blazingly fast performance.

# Performance

This plugin replaces `nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-refactor`
highlight-definitions which performs poorly on large files.

# install

Using Lazy:

```lua
  {
      'tzachar/local-highlight.nvim',
      config = function()
        require('local-highlight').setup()
      end
  },
```

Make sure to specify file types to attach to, or use the `attach` interface
documented below. 

# Why Another Highlight Plugin?

Multiple plugins to highlight the word under the cursor exist. However, none of them solved all of the following issues for me:
1. Performance (especially on large files)
2. Highlight mechanics: by using extmarks, the current format of each highlighted word remains the same (e.g., italics, treesitter highlights)

# Setup

You can setup local-highlight` as follows:`

```lua
require('local-highlight').setup({
    file_types = {'python', 'cpp'},
    hlgroup = 'TSDefinitionUsage',
    cw_hlgroup = nil,
})
```

## `hlgroup`

Specify the highlighting group to use.

By default, `local-highlight` will use the `LocalHighlight` highlight group, which it defines upon startup. If the group is already defined elsewhere in your config then it will not be overwritten. You can use any other group you desire.

## `cw_hlgroup`

Specify the highlighting group to use for the word under the cursor. Defaults to
`nil`, which means "Do not apply any highlighting".

## `file_types`

The plugin works out of the box if you want to use `FileType`s to attach to
buffers. 

If you do not supply the `file_types` configuration option, `local-highlight` will
attach by default to all buffers using the `BufRead` autocommand event.

## API

If you want to directly attach the plugin to your buffers, you can use any
`autocommand` to attach an event to your liking. For
example, to attach to *any* buffer:

```lua
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('BufRead', {
  pattern = {'*.*'},
  callback = function(data)
    require('local-highlight').attach(data.buf)
  end
})
```

The plugin will take care not to reattach and to delete the autocommands when
the buffer is closed.

# User Commands

## LocalHighlightToggle

Toggle local highlighting for the current buffer.

## LocalHighlightOff

Turn local highlighting off for the current buffer.

## LocalHighlightOn

Turn local highlighting on for the current buffer.

## LocalHighlightStats

Echo timing information: total number of invocations and the average running
time in milliseconds.

# How the Plugin Works

`local-highlight` will attach to a buffer and register an autocommand for the
`CursorHold` event. Once the event fires, `local-highlight` will grab the word
under the cursor and will highlight all of the usages of the same word in the
visible lines of the buffer.

One implication of using `CursorHold` is that interactivity depends on
`updatetime`, which is 4000 by default. A good advice is to set it to something
more reasonable, like 500, to get good interactivity.

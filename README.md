# local-highlight.nvim

Using regexes and extmarks to highlight uses of word under the cursor.
Keeps updates local to currently visible lines, thus enabling blazingly fast performance.

# Performance

This plugin replaces `nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-refactor`
highlight-definitions which performs poorly on large files.

# install

Using Lazy:

```lua
  {
      'tzachar/local-highlight.nvim',
      config = function()
        require('local-highlight').setup()
      end
  },
```

Make sure to specify file types to attach to, or use the `attach` interface
documented below. 

# Why Another Highlight Plugin?

Multiple plugins to highlight the word under the cursor exist. However, none of them solved all of the following issues for me:
1. Performance (especially on large files)
2. Highlight mechanics: by using extmarks, the current format of each highlighted word remains the same (e.g., italics, treesitter highlights)

# Setup

You can setup local-highlight` as follows:`

```lua
require('local-highlight').setup({
    file_types = {'python', 'cpp'}, -- If this is given only attach to this
    -- OR attach to every filetype except:
    disable_file_types = {'tex'},
    hlgroup = 'Search',
    cw_hlgroup = nil,
    -- Whether to display highlights in INSERT mode or not
    insert_mode = false,
    min_match_len = 1,
    max_match_len = math.huge,
    highlight_single_match = true,
})
```

## `hlgroup`

Specify the highlighting group to use.

By default, `local-highlight` will use the `LocalHighlight` highlight group, which it defines upon startup. If the group is already defined elsewhere in your config then it will not be overwritten. You can also use any other group you desire, e.g., see above where `Search` is used.

## `cw_hlgroup`

Specify the highlighting group to use for the word under the cursor. Defaults to
`nil`, which means "Do not apply any highlighting".

## `file_types` and `disable_file_types`

The plugin works out of the box if you want to use `FileType`s to attach to
buffers.

To control this behavior, you have the option of setting the following options:
`file_types`: `nil` by default, meaning attach to all file types. If set to a
table, should contain file types relevant to the `FileType` autocommand, and
will instruct the plugin to attach only to the specified fule types.
`disable_file_types`: `nil` by default, meaning no exceptions when attaching to
buffers. If set to a table, each fie type specified in the table will be skipped
when attaching to buffers.

If you set `file_types` to an empty table, `{}`, `local-highlight` will not
attach to any buffer on its own, and will leave all attach logic to the user.

## `insert_mode`

If set to `true`, will also work during insert mode.

## `min_match_len` and `max_match_len`

Set lower and upper limits on the length of the word being matched.

## `highlight_single_match`

Set to false to stop highlighting words that only appear once.

## API

If you want to directly attach the plugin to your buffers, you can use any
`autocommand` to attach an event to your liking. For
example, to attach to *any* buffer:

```lua
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('BufRead', {
  pattern = {'*.*'},
  callback = function(data)
    require('local-highlight').attach(data.buf)
  end
})
```

The plugin will take care not to reattach and to delete the autocommands when
the buffer is closed.

## Callbacks

### Match Count

You can request the current count of matches. This can be used, e.g., in a
status line plugin:

```lua
require('local-highlight').match_count(bufnr)
```

where `bufnr` is the buffer number the count is requested for or 0 for the
current buffer.

# User Commands

## LocalHighlightToggle

Toggle local highlighting for the current buffer.

## LocalHighlightOff

Turn local highlighting off for the current buffer.

## LocalHighlightOn

Turn local highlighting on for the current buffer.

## LocalHighlightStats

Echo timing information: total number of invocations and the average running
time in milliseconds.

# How the Plugin Works

`local-highlight` will attach to a buffer and register an autocommand for the
`CursorHold` event. Once the event fires, `local-highlight` will grab the word
under the cursor and will highlight all of the usages of the same word in the
visible lines of the buffer.

One implication of using `CursorHold` is that interactivity depends on
`updatetime`, which is 4000 by default. A good advice is to set it to something
more reasonable, like 500, to get good interactivity.
